        I'm 22 years old, in this moment i'm engaged with a very beautiful and spiritual girl. (but if you are looking to this in January 2022 I'm already married)</p>
    
    <p> Today I'm working as a supervisor in a local company in my state, but I'm studing to be a Devops in a future not so far way.
        I'm doing the Applied Tech degree and with this come the decision to go to the BYU-I, I love the way that I can learn tech and grow my spirity. </p>
